# Sentinel
Tool to check URL reputation through virus total and display its safety status 

The program takes one URL at a time, checks whether it is safe to visit or not, displays the category of the url i.e. what people visit it for and then provides an option to directly open the URL in chrome browser.

Sentinel is a simple program that has two versions: one which uses a virustotal API key and another that obtains safety status of the URL through parsing websites.
